# Movie Search

## Primary Functions
This website will allow a user to find out valuable information about any movie. 
<br>The user will type the title of a movie in the search bar, then the browser will return a photo of the movie cover to verify that is the movie they are looking for. 
<br>Once the user clicks on the photo of the movie cover, the browser will then fetch information on that movie from a separate source. 
<br>The page will then display information on that movie such as movie length and ratings. 
<br>The movie search will be saved in a 'recents' section where it can be accessed even after the browser is refreshed.

- Content availability venue(s) 
- Recommendation Engine based on user search
- Use a database instead of LocalStorage
- Ability to purchase tickets at a theater near you!
