# movie-search

## Primary Functions
This website will allow a user to find out valuable information about any movie. The user will type the title of a movie in the search bar, then the browser will return a photo of the movie cover to verify that is the movie they are looking for. Once the user clicks on the photo of the movie cover, the browser will then fetch information on that movie from a separate source. The page will then display information on that movie such as movie length, ratings, and a movie trailer. The movie title will be saved in a 'recents' section where it can be accessed even after the browser is refreshed.
